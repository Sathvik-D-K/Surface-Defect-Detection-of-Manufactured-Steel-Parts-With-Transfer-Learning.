# Surface-Defect-Detection-of-Manufactured-Steel-Parts-With-Transfer-Learning.
Steel is one of the most important building materials of modern times. Steel buildings are resistant to natural and man-made wear which has made the material ubiquitous around the world. To help make production of steel more efficient, this deep learning model will help identify defects.

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/severstal-steel-defect-detection/data

The Dataset was acquired from one of the leading Russian steel companies operating in the field of Steel and mining industry, Severstal. With the onset of the 4th Industrial revolution and constant growth in the manufacturing industry, steel played an integral role due to its high tensile strength complemented with low cost, whether giant structures to small tools and products, automobiles, and even in the weapon-making industry.The Severstal dataset provided two sets of images, Test Images (5506 images) and Train Images (12568 images). Moreover, each image has a unique ImageID which can be categorized in four classes [1,2,3,4 ], an image might have no defect, defect of a single class, or defects of multiple classes.

The project is to implement transfer learning on defect detection on steel surfaces using the Severstal dataset. From the results shown above, we have successfully implemented transfer learning using the Xception Model. The validation accuracy of 0.9886 is achieved.
